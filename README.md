## Northern Trail Outfitters Sample App

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/trailheadapps/northern-trail-outfitters.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/trailheadapps/northern-trail-outfitters)

Northern Trail Outfitters (NTO) is a fictional outdoor clothing company. This application helps NTO merchandisers create “merchandise mixes” for their large retailers . A merchandise mix is a collection of products a retailer carries for a season. Merchandise mixes are submitted to a Heroku-hosted sample manufacturing app using Platform Events. Regardless of the industry you work in, this app demonstrates how to build applications with Lightning Components and how to use Platform Events to integrate with external systems.

## Code Highlights

### Caching data with storable actions

Storable actions make it easy to implement client-side data caching, which is one of the most impactful things you can do to improve the performance of your Lightning components. Check out [MerchandiseListHelper](https://github.com/trailheadapps/northern-trail-outfitters/blob/master/force-app/main/default/aura/MerchandiseList/MerchandiseListHelper.js) and [MerchandiseMixHelper](https://github.com/trailheadapps/northern-trail-outfitters/blob/master/force-app/main/default/aura/MerchandiseMix/MerchandiseMixHelper.js). A storable action is used to retrieve funds from the server and cache the response at the client-side. Read [this blog post](https://developer.salesforce.com/blogs/developer-relations/2017/03/lightning-components-best-practices-caching-data-storable-actions.html) for more information.

### Caching data with a custom cache

In addition to storable actions, you can also build your own custom cache solution. For example, for data that never (or rarely) changes, you can build a custom cache that retrieves the data from the server once, caches the response, and never goes back to the server. Check out the [DataCache](force-app/main/default/staticresources/DataCache.js) static resource for an example. And then check out the [CategorySelector](https://github.com/trailheadapps/northern-trail-outfitters/tree/master/force-app/main/default/aura/CategorySelector) component to see how it’s used to cache the list of categories. Read the [Modularizing Code in Lightning Components blog post](https://developer.salesforce.com/blogs/developer-relations/2016/12/lightning-components-code-sharing.html) for more details, and for different strategies to implement a custom cache.

### Using Base Lightning Components

Custom user interfaces are built by leveraging Base Lightning Components like [lightning:path](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.lightning.meta/lightning/aura_compref_lightning_path.htm). This simplifies the development experience as validations, CSS-styling and and data handling are automatically handled by the platform. See the [MixPath](force-app/main/default/aura/MixPath) component for an example.

### Third-party JavaScript libraries and standard HTML5 interactions
The [MixChart](https://github.com/trailheadapps/northern-trail-outfitters/blob/master/force-app/main/default/aura/MixChart) component shows how a third-party library like [ChartJS](https://www.chartjs.org/) can be used within Lightning Experience. The [MerchandiseMix](force-app/main/default/aura/MerchandiseMix) component provides another example and uses the [countUp.js](https://github.com/inorganik/countUp.js/) library. MerchandiseMix also shows how to use standard HTML 5 functionality like [drag & drop](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTML_Drag_and_Drop_API).

## Additional Resources

Install the [Northern Trail Outfitters Manufacturing](https://github.com/trailheadapps/northern-trail-manufacturing) app to experiment with platform event-based integration.

When you create a Merchandise Mix in Salesforce and change its status to **Submitted to Manufacturing**, the **Mix Status Change** process automatically publishes the **Mix_Submitted__e** platform event. The manufacturing app is listening for that event and automatically adds the merchandise mix to the mix list when a **Mix_Submitted__e** event comes in.

When you click the **Approve** button next to a merchandise mix in the manufacturing app, the manufacturing app publishes a **Mix_Approved__e** event. The **Mix Status Change** process (in Process Builder) listens for that event and automatically changes the bundle status to **Approved by Manufacturing** when an event comes in. If a user is looking at the record details page for that mix, the status will automatically change (no page refresh required) because the status path component is using the Streaming API to listen for status changes. For this last part to work, you need to execute the following Salesforce DX command to create the Streaming API topic:

```
sfdx force:apex:execute -f ./apex/createPushTopic.apex
```

Take a look at the `createPushTopic.apex` file in the `/apex` folder to examine the push topic creation logic.

Note that you could also have listened directly for the platform event in the status path component and update the status to **Approved by Manufacturing** in the UI when the event comes in. However, that approach could lead to inconsistencies in case the server-side status update (handled by the **Mix Status Change** process) fails, because a validation rule is not met for example. In that case the UI would show the status as **Approved by Manufacturing**, while the status in the database would still be **Submitted to Manufacturing**.
